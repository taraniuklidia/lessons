            The front door of the mouse house opened into a charming kitchen, bathed in the warm glow <br> 
            of a lantern hanging from the ceiling. The kitchen was a hub of activity, with a rustic <br> wooden table in the center surrounded by mismatched acorn cups and saucers. Mrs. Fieldmouse <br> was a wonderful cook, and the kitchen was always filled with the delightful <br> aroma of freshly baked acorn bread and blackberry jam. The pantry, tucked away in one <br> corner, was a treasure trove of nuts, seeds, and berries gathered during the summer, <br> ensuring the family had plenty to eat during the colder months.
