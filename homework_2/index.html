            <h2>About the house owners</h2>
            <p>
                In the heart of Brambly Hedge, nestled beneath a tangle of wild roses and honeysuckle,<br>
                was the cozy home of the Fieldmouse family. It was a quaint little house made from twigs,<br>
                leaves, and woven grass, and it was perfectly tailored to the needs of its tiny inhabitants:<br>
                <mark>Mr. and Mrs. Fieldmouse</mark> and their three young ones, <mark>Daisy, Pip, and Tumble</mark>.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Brambly Hedge, a house so small,<br>
                Made of twigs, leaves, and dreams that call.<br>
                With lantern's light in the <a target="_blank" href="kitchen.html">kitchen's</a> nook,<br>
                And in cozy <a target="_blank" href="bedroom.html">bedroom</a> where dreams are forsook.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                <a target="_blank" href="pantry.html">Pantry</a> stocked with treasures kept,<br>
                Nuts and seeds, carefully swept.<br>
                In the <a target="_blank" href="outside.html">garden</a>, swings on the old oak tree,<br>
                A world of joy for the Fieldmouse family.   
            </p>

            <p>
                In this small house, love's sweet embrace,<br>
                In every corner, a cherished place.<br>
                Brambly Hedge, where dreams do dwell,<br>
                A tiny home, but its stories, they swell.
            </p>
